# This is a top level header

## *This is a second level header with italics*

Using markdown can be fun for quickly creating web-friendly text, `sharing code`, etc. 
NB: A single carriage return isn't enough for a line break.  To seperate paragraphs, you must do two,

like so.  You can also put two spaces at the end of the line for a simple line break without creating a new paragraph,  
like so.

This is example code in JavaScript to show how markdown allows for nice code-snippet formatting:

``` javascript
const shoutOfFrustration = function() {
    console.log('AAAAARRRRGGGGHHHH!!!');
}

shoutOfFrustration;


```
